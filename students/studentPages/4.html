    <P>My name is Ajsal Muhammed,yet to be a succesful guy who is figuring out what to do.<br>
    So for now, I am working for my best results in my 12 grade.I got my 10th certificate from a cbse school, so I am little weak on my mother tongue.<br>
    It's not something that I am proud of but it is what it is.I got a broken Fibula,incompleted beard,which look like an island but inside out.<br>
    Some of my hobbies are movies,books and telling delusional stories etc.I am an ambivert.I do love my social life but I tend to keep it small.<br>
    My favorite genres about my life is to have a good time with family and friends.I think my life is directed by Martin Scorsese because it's boring and slow paced.<br>
    I hate to be a 9 to 5 guy but I do love having a normal life with a loyal spouse and 2 kids to make it more real.<br>
    I am a discplined guy who wants to do good in both "dunya" and "akhira".<br>
   So that's it,that's about me.</P>
