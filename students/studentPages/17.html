    <h2>Hi! I’m Muhammed Jaseem, a 12th grade student with a fascination for Computer Science.<br>
    What started as a hobby of exploring computer programs and troubleshooting devices quickly turned into a deeper interest in<br>
    computer science,web development,and understanding how the internet works.</h2>
    <h2>I am drawn to the problem-solving and analytical aspects of computer science. I’ve always enjoyed math, puzzles, and logic games, which have helped sharpen my thinking skills.<br>
    Over time, I've realized that computer science is not just about coding; it’s about solving real-world problems creatively and efficiently.<br>
    This realization has only strengthened my resolve to build a career in this field.<br></h2>
    <h2>Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to apply what I’ve learned.<br>
    I also actively participate in online coding platforms like CodeChef and HackerRank, where I compete in coding challenges to improve my skills.<br></h2>
    <h2>Looking ahead, I am excited to further my knowledge in computer science, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software engineering. My goal is to pursue a degree in computer science and contribute to the tech industry, either by developing innovative software or by solving problems that impact people's lives.</h2>
    <h2>As I embark on this journey, I am grateful for the support from my family, teachers, and friends, who have always encouraged me to follow my interests. I believe that with dedication and continuous learning, I can turn my passion for computer science into a meaningful career.</h2>
